# Artificial Intelligence Lab

This repository contains implementations of various Artificial Intelligence (AI) algorithms and tasks, organized by lab sessions. Starting from foundational AI concepts, the repository transitions into Machine Learning (ML) techniques in later labs.

## Folder Structure
- **23F-0043_Lab1 to Lab10**: Focuses on core AI topics such as search algorithms, logic-based reasoning, and optimization problems.
- **23F-0043_Lab11**: Introduces Machine Learning concepts, including clustering algorithms like K-Means and K-Medoids.
- **aima/**: Core AI algorithms and utilities inspired by the "Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach" textbook.
- **provided/**: Additional utilities and helper scripts for tasks like N-Queens, TSP, etc.
- **imgs/**: Visualizations and images related to AI algorithms.

## Key Topics Covered
- **Search Algorithms**: BFS, DFS, Hill Climbing, Simulated Annealing, etc.
- **Constraint Satisfaction Problems (CSPs)**: Solving problems like N-Queens and Sudoku.
- **Propositional and First-Order Logic**: Resolution, refutation, and reasoning with knowledge bases.
- **Game Playing Agents**: Minimax and Alpha-Beta pruning.
- **Optimization Problems**: Techniques for solving complex optimization tasks.
- **Machine Learning**: Transitioned to ML in Lab 11, focusing on clustering techniques such as K-Means and K-Medoids.
