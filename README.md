# Artificial Intelligence Lab

This repository contains implementations of various Artificial Intelligence (AI) algorithms and tasks, organized by lab sessions. Below is an overview of the structure:

## Folder Structure
- **23F-0043_Lab1 to Lab10**: Contains Python scripts and Jupyter notebooks for specific AI tasks and algorithms.
- **aima/**: Core AI algorithms and utilities inspired by the "Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach" textbook.
- **provided/**: Additional utilities and helper scripts for tasks like N-Queens, TSP, etc.
- **imgs/**: Visualizations and images related to AI algorithms.

## Key Topics Covered
- Search Algorithms: BFS, DFS, Hill Climbing, Simulated Annealing, etc.
- Constraint Satisfaction Problems (CSPs)
- Propositional and First-Order Logic
- Game Playing Agents
- Optimization Problems

## How to Use
1. Install dependencies from `requirements.txt`.
2. Navigate to the desired lab folder and run the scripts or notebooks.
3. Refer to the `aima/` folder for reusable AI utilities.

## Requirements
- Python 3.9+
- Required libraries listed in `requirements.txt`.
